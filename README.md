# GGJ2024.

This is our attempt to develop a game in 48 hours as part of this year's Global Game Jam. We were prompted to stick with the theme: "Make me Laugh".

## Jester's Jest

King Chuckles the First, known for his hearty laughter, has fallen into a deep melancholy after the passing of the previous buffoon. The court physicians believe that only a collection of unique and rare items with the power to amuse can save the king from a humorless demise. Your task is clear: venture through the diverse landscapes of Mirthland, face quirky challenges, and gather the whimsical artifacts needed to break the king's sorrow.
